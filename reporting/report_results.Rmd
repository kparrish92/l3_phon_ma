# Meta-analyisis of L3 phonology studies of VOT production

5 total empirical studies were examined, in which 20 total comparisons could be made per language pairing (L1 and L2, L2 and L3, and L1 and L3). These studies involved a variety of language trios, including Polish, Spanish, English, French, and German. All studies examined late bilinguals who produced word initial plosives in each of their three languages. Some studies in this pool report means and standard deviations per stop consonant (/p/, /t/, /k/). These cases were treated as independent samples, although this may increase the risk of 
pseudoreplication. Effect sizes were determined given means and standard deviations of absolute VOT measurements and standard error was computed for each effect size. Due to the presence of many language pairings, the absolute value of effect size was taken, so that the magnitude of effects could be focused on, rather than directionality. 

*The formula used to compute standard error of an effect size was `SE = sqrt(2(1 - r)/n) + es/2n))`, where `r` is the correlation of within subjects responses (set to .5), `n` is the number of participants in the study, and `es` is the effect size, expressed as a standardized mean difference. 

## Analysis 

In order to determine a pooled effect, a Bayesian Generalized (Non-)Linear Multivariate Multilevel Model was fir using the `brm` function in R. The effect size (a standardized mean difference) was the outcome variable and was modeled as a function of stop consonant and study. As a result, an intercept only model was fit with the random effects of stop and study per language pairing. The pooled effect size was determined by examining the intercept of the model, which provided a distribution of plausible estimates of the pooled effect size for language across studies.  

The priors in this study follow Casillas (2021) in that it included regularizing, weakly informative priors that were normally distributed and centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 1 for all population-level parameters, a cauchy prior set at 0 with scale 1 was used for $\tau$ and that the model was fit with 4000 iterations (2000 warm-up) and Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo sampling was carried out with 4 chains distributed across 4 processing cores.

## Results

### L1-L2 comparison 

The results of all three language pairings suggest that the body of literature has not provided evidence for clear results when it comes to cross-language interactions of VOT in L3 learners. First, for the L1-L2 language pairing, the probability of the average effect size being greater than .4 was `r prob_gt_41`.  The plot below is a forest plot of the effect size estimate per study, and includes a pooled estimate of all studies. The estimate for the L1-L2 comparison was `r median(l1_l2_brm$b_Intercept) %>% round(digits = 2)` [95% HDI = `r hdi(l1_l2_brm$b_Intercept)[1] %>% round(digits = 2)`, `r hdi(l1_l2_brm$b_Intercept)[2] %>% round(digits = 2)`]. This result is troublesome, since it is essentially a prerequisite of L3 research that speakers have relatively stable and independent categories in their L1 and their L2. Without this clear difference between the L1 and L2, it is not plausible to draw conclusions as to which of these languages affects L3 production. Due to the seemingly high variability in VOT production, particularly in the L2, larger sample sizes are necessary to provide evidence that bilinguals are producing their L1 and L2 using language-specific distributions of VOT values. Alternatively, smaller samples could be used if it could be verified that a participant pool consistently produce native-like VOT in their L2, as the source of variability could also be explained by variability in L2 proficiency.

### L2-L3 and L1-L2 Comparisons 

Given that the pooled estimate of L1-L2 difference was inconclusive, the comparisons for other language pairing cannot reliably be attributed to the L1 or the L2. Nonetheless, the results are reported here. For the L2-L3 language pairing, the probability of the average effect size being greater than .4 was `r prob_gt_42`, and the esimate was `r median(l2_l3_brm$b_Intercept) %>% round(digits = 2)` 
[95% HDI = `r hdi(l2_l3_brm$b_Intercept)[1] %>% round(digits = 2)`, 
`r hdi(l2_l3_brm$b_Intercept)[2] %>% round(digits = 2)`]. For the L1-L3 language pairing, the probability of the average effect size being greater than .4 was `r prob_gt_43`, and the estimate was `r median(l1_l3_brm$b_Intercept) %>% round(digits = 2)` [95% HDI = `r hdi(l1_l3_brm$b_Intercept)[1] %>% round(digits = 2)`, 
`r hdi(l1_l3_brm$b_Intercept)[2] %>% round(digits = 2)`]. Forest plots for both language pairings can be seen below.

## Brief Discussion 

These results suggest that the VOT studies done with L3 learners are largely inconclusive. Much larger samples are needed (likely n > 80 per group). A larger sample ought to provide evidence that L3 learners at least have two reliably separate distributions of VOT values that could represent underlying language-specific categories. Without this criterion as a starting point, there is not reasonable support to evaluate the predictions of L3 models. 

The figure below demonstrates that  the plausible Bayesian estimates of effect sizes per language pairing vary greatly. The vertical, dashed lines represent small, medium and large effect sizes as standardized mean differences (.4 = small, .7 = medium, 1 = large; Plonsky & Oswald, 2014).

As can be seen in the figure, the distribution of plausible effect sizes includes 0, small effects, medium effects, and some large effects. As a result, it is difficult to make clear and categorical conclusions based on this data.
